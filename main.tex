% Sample Notre Dame Thesis/Dissertation
% Using Donald Peterson's ndthesis classfile

%
% Nothing in this document is serious except the format.  :-)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is *not* a substitute for the documentation, which is included
% as a pdf file in the standard distribution, and can be obatined from
% the dtx file in the advanced distribution.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have
% all the relevant parts, put the captions in the right place, etc.
% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean
% that it removes *all* the formatting onus from you.  :-)
% Although be warned that the Graduate School has been known to let
% their official formatting guide get out of date. When in doubt,
% the Microsoft Word example seemed to be the only thing kept
% consistently up-to-date in 2013, and is probably the safest thing
% to consult.
%
% You should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \include
% command, as has been done here for chapters 1 and 2 and the appendix.
% There is also an \input command, but \include is more commonly used to
% import chapters in books and dissertations. For the differences between these
% two commands, see, e.g., 
% http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rdale/resources/writingnotes/latexstruct.html
% or http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include.
%
% If you compile from the command line, note that you should also have 
% a good Makefile; one that invokes LaTeX as many times as necessary 
% (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
%
% If you use an editor that allows you to compile from within the
% program, note that you will need to compile up to four times. Also,
% we recommend that you use pdflatex (sometimes displayed as
% LaTeX => PDF) to compile directly to pdf.
%
% If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, please send e-mail
% to: dteditor@nd.edu

\documentclass[final,numrefs,sort&compress,noinfo]{nddiss2e}
% One of the options draft, review, final must be chosen.
% One of the options textrefs or numrefs should be chosen
% to specify if you want numerical or ``author-date''
% style citations.
% Other available options are:
% 10pt/11pt/12pt (available with draft only)
% twoadvisors
% noinfo (should be used when you compile the final time
%         for formal submission)
% sort (sorts multiple citations in the order that they're
%       listed in the bibliography)
% compress (compresses numerical citations, e.g. [1,2,3]
%           becomes [1-3]; has no effect when used with
%           the textrefs option)
% sort&compress (sorts and compresses numerical citations;
%           is identical to sort when used with textrefs)

\begin{abstract}
    E0 components of transitions between two states of the same spin and parity are challenging to measure, with sparse information available in nuclear databases. A recent study of $^{154}$Gd (D. A. Meyer et al, PRC 044309(2006)) showed the nucleus to have 16 0$^+$ states. $^{154}$Gd is well-studied by a number of reactions, hence it is an ideal candidate to search for E0 transitions. We will report on our results for transitions in $^{154}$Gd following the $^{152}$Sm($\alpha$,2n) reaction using the Internal Conversion Electron Ball (ICEBall) array in coincidence with $\gamma$-rays at the University of Notre Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL). ICEBall was re-implemented at the NSL 4 years ago and the $\gamma$-rays were detected by Clovershare, segmented HPGe detectors purchased by the Yale Nuclear Structure Laboratory that are shared by a consortium of universities and laboratories for experimental campaigns.
