    \caption{Timing between two of the Clovershare detectors, with one detector gated on 123 keV, the lowest transition in the ground state band of $^{154}$Gd. In this data, the gates all looked similarly symmetric, and the timing gates did not need to be varied as they had for the GEORGINA set up.}
