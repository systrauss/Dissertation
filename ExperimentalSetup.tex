\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:setup}

\section{Overview}

To measure conversion electrons for nuclear structure, three separate experiments were performed at the Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of the Notre Dame using the Internal Conversion Electron Ball (ICEBall) Spectrometer paired with several configurations of High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors. A Sm$(\alpha,2n)$Gd reaction was used with different enriched targets to create the desired Gd isotope.

\section{Nuclear Science Laboratory at Notre Dame}

The Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame has been in operation since the 1930s. Currently, the NSL operates locally with three accelerators: the 10 MV FN Tandem, the 5 MV Sta. Ana accelerator, and the 3 MV 9S Tandem. There is also a fourth accelerator, a 1 MV machine called CASPAR, located in the Homestake Mines in South Dakota. The experiments in this dissertation were performed on the 10 MV FN Tandem. Figure \ref{fig:NSL} is the current layout of the NSL. The accelerator in the top right of the figure is the FN Tandem.

The FN Tandem has two ion sources: the Helium Ion Source (HIS) and the Multi-Cathode Source of Negative Ions Using Cesium Sputtering (MC-SNICS). Most elements can take the electrons from cesium to create negative ions. Helium cannot and needs a special source, as discussed below. For the experiments described, the HIS was used.

Due to the electron binding energy of helium, the HIS uses a duoplasmatron. Within the duoplasmatron, a thin tungsten wire is heated while surrounded by the source gas (helium). The tungsten wire emits electrons, and positively ionizes the helium. This helium is extracted from the duoplasmatron and focused by an einzel lens, where it then goes through the lithium charge exchange. This section of the HIS works much like the Tandem, although the charge exchange works in reverse. The positively charged ions are accelerated through a lithium vapor, and some gain electrons, becoming neutral or negatively charged. Those ions that become negatively charged are accelerated out the other end of the HIS, before being sent to the FN Tandem. Figure \ref{fig:HIS} is a schematic of this system.

\input{Setup_Figs/NSL_Layout.tex}

The 10 MV FN Tandem has been in operation since 1968. It operates using a Van de Graaff system. Charging chains carrying a static charge deposit the charge on a terminal in the center of the machine. The charging chains are a pelletron system, upgraded from the original insulated belt system in 2000. The pelletron chain consists of metal pellets connected using nylon, allowing for each pellet to be electrically isolated as it carries electrical charge to the terminal \citep{nec:_pelletron}. The beamline is kept at vacuum, but the area outside of the beamline, but within the accelerator tank, is filled with a mixture of CO$_2$ and dry nitrogen gas, at approximately 200 PSI. To create a more uniform acceleration field, the terminal is brought to ground along the beamline using resistor-lined tubes. The resistors used create a uniform electrical field down the tube, allowing for uniform acceleration.

It is known as a tandem because the system is a two-stage acceleration. Negatively charged ions enter the system, accelerating toward a positively charged terminal shell. Inside of the shell, the ions go through carbon stripping foils 3 $\mu g/cm^2$ thick, becoming positively charged as electrons are pulled off. The ions then accelerate away from the terminal for the second stage. The total energy gained by the ions is the terminal voltage times the quantity of one plus the final charge state.

\input{Setup_Figs/HIS.tex}

\section{Target Fabrication}

For conversion electron experiments, thinner targets are ideal. Electrons must escape the target for detection, and a thicker target causes energy loss and straggling effects, blurring out the conversion electron spectrum.

Enriched, self-supporting samarium targets were used for this experiment. Table \ref{tab:target} has the enrichment and thickness of the targets used. The material started as Sm$_2$O$_3$. Using the reaction

\begin{equation}
    Sm_2O_3 + Hf \xrightarrow{} HfO_2 + Sm
    \label{eq:sm_hf}
\end{equation}

at a temperature of 1520-1820 K the samarium was extracted as a metal \citep{clifford02:_target}. Once cooled, it was rolled as thin as possible. Samarium easily oxidizes, stagnating the rolling process, as too much work on the material at once could cause instantaneous oxidization, resulting in the loss of the target. Rolling had to be done incrementally, giving the material time to rest.

\input{Setup_Figs/targetable.tex}

\section{Internal Conversion Electron Ball Spectrometer}

The Internal Conversion Electron Ball Spectrometer (ICEBall) was developed at the University of Pittsburgh by Metlay et al. \citep{metlay92:_iceball_comm,metlay93:_iceball_comm}. Originally at the Spin Spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, it was later stationed at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University with the YRAST Ball, until being brought to the University of Notre Dame and stationed in the Nuclear Science Laboratory West Target Room, on a dedicated beamline \citep{battaglia15:_iceball_176lu}.

Originally designed to go inside of large gamma detector arrays, ICEBall consists of six mini-orange spectrometers, cooled using liquid nitrogen for ideal energy resolution. The liquid nitrogen is administered using an autofill system with two thermal sensors for a start and stop signal. When the sensor closest to the detectors warms enough, liquid nitrogen is pumped into the system. A second sensor at the top of the dewar is used to stop the fill of liquid nitrogen before it overflows. This system goes off in 15 to 20 minute intervals.

\subsection{Detectors}

The detectors inside of ICEBall are lithium-drifted silicon detectors, known colloquially as Si(Li) detectors. Si(Li) detectors allow for a larger depletion region in the detector, compared to pure silicon detectors, and can be made thicker as a result. The detectors inside of ICEBall are 5 mm thick, with a surface area of 750 mm$^2$ \citep{metlay93:_iceball_comm}. Table \ref{tab:ICE_Det_Loc} summarizes the locations of the six Si(Li) detectors inside of ICEBall, using spherical coordinates. A thin aluminized mylar foil is placed in front of the Si(Li) detectors to block low-energy electrons and $\delta$-rays that successfully make it past the mini-orange filter.

\input{Setup_Figs/ICEBall_Location.tex}

Between the detectors and the target are mini-orange filters. Designed in the 1970s, mini-orange filters are a permanent magnet array surrounding a high-Z material, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:mini_orange}. In ICEBall, this material is tungsten, and the magnets are made of SmCo$_5$, and arranged in groups of 3. The tungsten acts as a blocker, lowering background from the target that can be due to $\gamma$ rays and heavy charged particles. The magnets create a field that bends electrons toward the detector, while bending positrons away from the detector, further lowering background noise. 

\input{Setup_Figs/miniOrange_fig.tex}

Compared to conventional spectrometers that sweep over electron energies by changing the magnetic field of the spectrometer, the mini-orange spectrometers are able to cover a wide range of energies at once. A drawback of this is the permanent magnets. The field is optimized for a range of energies, and must be pre-selected before the experiment. Switching magnets mid-experiment is not feasible, due to the downtime needed to warm-up the system, bring it to atmosphere, replace the filter, and then return the system to data taking conditions. Additionally, the efficiency of the system is a convolution of the detector's efficiency and the mini-orange filter in front of it, meaning each configuration must have a separate efficiency measurement. Tables \ref{tab:ICE_Magnet_G} and \ref{tab:ICE_Magnet_C} summarize the magnetic configurations of the mini-orange filters used in the experiments.

\input{Setup_Figs/ICEBallMagnetTableG.tex}

\input{Setup_Figs/ICEBallMagnetTableC.tex}

\subsection{Calibration}

ICEBall is calibrated using two sources: $^{133}$Ba and $^{207}$Bi. The specific properties of the two sources are listed in Table \ref{tab:ICE_Cal_Source}. The $^{207}$Bi covers the high-energy regime, with lines around 500 keV and 1000 keV. The $^{133}$Ba covered energies from 200 to 400 keV. Both sources are low activity, preventing incomplete or overlapping charge collection from hindering the resolution of the detectors during calibration runs. 

\input{Setup_Figs/ICEBall_calSource.tex}

The energy calibration is assumed to be quadratic in nature, although both linear and quadratic calibrations are performed. Figure \ref{fig:iceball_cal} shows both of these fits and their respective residuals for one of the Si(Li) detectors. These values are summarized in the next chapter for each experiment.

\input{Setup_Figs/iceball_calibration_fig.tex}

The efficiency calibration is fitted to equation

\begin{equation}
    ln(\epsilon) = p_1+p_2ln(E)+p_3E
    \label{eq:SiLi_Eff}
\end{equation}

The efficiency is a convolution of the magnetic configuration and the inherent detector efficiency. Using the efficiency points, the analytic expression for the efficiency was determined empirically in previous work \citep{battaglia15:_iceball_176lu}. These experimental values are summarized in the next chapter for each experiment.

\section{GEORGINA}

GEORGINA is a compact array of high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors for $\gamma$-ray experiments\citep{isnap18:_georgina}. The detectors are 109\% relative efficiency. These detectors were designed for use with astrophysical capture reactions, meant to cover a large solid angle. There are a total of five detectors.

\subsection{Detectors}

While the GEORGINA detectors were designed for reasonable efficiency up to 12 MeV, they were used in this experiment to look at energies up to 4 MeV. Two detectors of the five were used in this experiment. The detectors were designed with the crystal at a $90^{\circ}$ from the cold-finger, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:georgina}.

\input{Setup_Figs/georgina_fig.tex}

\input{Setup_Figs/georgina_locations.tex}

One of the two detectors had Bismuth Germanate (BGO) detectors from Argonne National Laboratory around it to cut down on background from incomplete charge collection. BGO detectors have a high efficiency, but poor resolution, and are good to use as a veto system. In the event that a gamma-ray does not deposit its full energy in the HPGe crystal, the BGO detectors surrounding the crystal should pick up the remaining energy. This indicates the event was incomplete in energy and should be excluded from the data. For more on the electronics logic for this, see section \ref{sec:GEORGINA_electronics}.

\subsection{Calibration}

The GEORGINA detectors were calibrated using a $^{152}$Eu source, in addition to the ICEBall sources. The information about the sources is in Table \ref{tab:GEORGINA_Cal_Source}. The $^{152}$Eu source was not designed to sit perfectly on the target ladder, while the two ICEBall sources were. So, even though the Eu source was attached to the target ladder for calibration, using it as a measure of absolute efficiency was not possible. To use the $^{152}$Eu for efficiency, a linear extrapolation of the efficiency of the 344 keV line was done using the 303 keV and 356 keV lines in $^{133}$Ba. All points in the Eu were then scaled based on this. Additionally, several background lines could be used to extend the energy calibration up to 2700 keV. The energy calibration was assumed to be a polynomial, and fits up to the fifth order were done to find the best calibration without overfitting. For examples of these fits and a summary of the determined coefficients, see the next chapter.

\input{Setup_Figs/georgina_calibration_table.tex}

The efficiency calibration is fitted to equation

\begin{equation}
    ln(\epsilon) = a_0-(a_1+a_2\times e^{-a_3\times E})\times E^{-a_4\times E}\times ln(E)
    \label{eq:Ge_Eff}
\end{equation}

This is the same efficiency curve used for the Clovershare detectors, and a characteristic fit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:clover_eff}. For a summary of the calibration points, please see the next chapter.

\subsection{Electronics and Data Structure}
\label{sec:GEORGINA_electronics}

The data taken with the ICEBall-Georgina pairing of detectors used the electronics set-up from previous experiments\citep{battaglia15:_iceball_176lu}. Signals from the Si(Li), HPGe, and BGO detectors were split into two signals, one for timing and one for energy, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:iceball_electronics}. After going through several NIM (Nuclear Instrumentation Modules) to clean up the signals, these were fed into two VME (Versa Module Europa) bus modules for analog-to-digital conversion. Energy signals were converted using the Mesytec analog-to-digital converter (MADC-32) module. This module has 13 bit resolution. The timing signals were converted using a Caen V778 time-to-digital converter (TDC) module, with 12 bit resolution.

\input{Setup_Figs/iceball_electronics.tex}

The BGO detectors went through an amplifier before being fed directly into the MADC-32. Both the Si(Li)s and the HPGe detectors went into a preamplifier before going into an amplifier, and then the MADC-32. The amplifier allowed for the adjustment of the gain, to optimize the energy regime of interest. The timing signals were sent through a Timing Filter Amplifier (TFA) before going through a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) and being split into start and stop signals, as well as being recorded into the scalers. The stop signal was delayed by \~500ns to prevent self-triggering. Start timing signals were put into a logic coincidence for the trigger. The trigger could be adjusted if the count rate were too high, but the ideal case was the "OR" coincidence, where a Si(Li) or HPGe detector could trigger the start. When this occurred, the signal was sent to a trigger, which sent the TDC a start signal. Stop signals could come from any of the three types of detectors, or the bunched beam being used.

The data was collected from the VME modules using the Michigan State University NSCL data acquisition system (DAQ)\citep{nscl:_daq}. The data file, known as an event or "evt" file, is only compatible with the analysis software SpecTcl\citep{nscl:_daq}. For online analysis, SpecTcl was used. However, for the purposes of gating and fitting, it is inadequate. These evt files were instead converted into "root" files, for use with the CERN Root Data Analysis Framework\citep{brun97:_root}. This open source software is programmable through C++, allowing for a robust set of features. This conversion was done using a program called \texttt{evt2root}\citep{smith14:_evt2root}.

\section{CloverShare}

CloverShare is a group of HPGe clover detectors with BGO shields, that originated at Yale University. They were sent to various laboratories and universities for series of experiments, including the NSL. Two campaigns of experiments were run with CloverShare, each one involving an ICEBall experiment.

\subsection{Detectors}

The CloverShare detectors are large, segmented HPGe detectors, with fitted BGO shields. In the first of the two experiments, 7 detectors were used. In the second, 5 were used, as two experienced pre-amplifier problems during the previous campaign. The detectors used biases between -3000 and -4000 V, and were kept cold using a liquid nitrogen autofill system.

Due to the fixed nature of the ICEBall detectors, the clovers were limited in the angles they could be placed at to optimize efficiency. With the tungsten blockers in front of the Si(Li) detectors to block gamma-rays and x-rays, placing the clovers behind these detectors would drastically reduce efficiency. The system was modeled in AutoDesk Inventor \citep{autodesk:_inventor} to visualize the detector placement, and find an ideal setup to optimize the HPGe detectors. Figure \ref{fig:inventor} shows the resulting model and placements, as well as several unmoveable obstructions, like cable trays, that needed to be worked around.

\input{Setup_Figs/inventor.tex}

\subsection{Calibration}

The CloverShare detectors were calibrated using the same sources as GEORGINA, as well as at $^{56}$Co source that was created on the FN accelerator days before the experiment. The information about the sources is in Table \ref{tab:GEORGINA_Cal_Source} and \ref{tab:Co_Energy}. 

\input{Setup_Figs/Co_Calibration.tex}

The $^{152}$Eu was placed on the individual detectors instead of centered in the trap, as it does not mount well to the target ladder. To use the $^{152}$Eu for efficiency, a linear extrapolation of the efficiency of the 344 keV line was done using the 303 keV and 356 keV lines in $^{133}$Ba. All points in the Eu were then scaled based on this. A characteristic fit of the efficiency of these detectors can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:clover_eff}. A summary of the calibrated efficiency values can be seen in the next chapter.

\input{Setup_Figs/clover_eff_fig.tex}

As the clovers are comprised of four separate crystals, the efficiency was taken for the individual leaves, and once the detectors had been calibrated, they were summed together. Figure \ref{fig:Clover_ind_vs_sum} shows the comparison. As is expected, there is a small improvement in the higher energies. The summed crystals were used for analysis, and will be used in spectra from here on forward.

\input{Setup_Figs/clover_ind_vs_sum.tex}

Each leaf of the clovers was energy calibrated. An unusual trend in the residuals was found in all cases, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Clover_ene_res}. This trend could not be corrected for by using a higher-order polynomial, as is usually the case for integral non-linearities in multi-channel analyzers \citep{knoll00:rad_det_meas}. Instead, this appears to be a differential non-linearity in the electronics, resulting in discontinuities. As will be discussed in the next section, the electronics used for the experiment are not primarily used with detectors of this sensitivity.

\input{Setup_Figs/Clover_resid.tex}

\subsection{Electronics}

The electronics used for the Clovershare series of experiments were designed for use with the High Efficiency TOtal absorption spectrometeR (HECTOR), a NaI(Tl) detector array\citep{reingold19:_HECTOR}. The HECTOR data acquisition system is the Michigan Sate University NSCL digital data acquisition system (DDAS). This system uses three XIA Pixie-16 modules \citep{xia:_pixie} which are 16 channel 14-bit 100 MSPS digitizers. Signals from detectors were fed directly from the preamplifiers to the Pixie modules, which did the amplification, shaping, timing, and logic triggers within the module through adjustments on the data acquisition computer. NaI(Tl) detectors have far lower resolution than HPGe detectors, so the differential non-linearities are not noticeable in the HECTOR data.

The Pixie modules were unable to produce enough gain in the amplifier section for the Si(Li) detectors to cover a significant number of channels for resolution, so the detectors' signals were put through fast filter amplifiers \citep{ortec:_fastamp} to boost the signal before being fed into the DDAS. Fast amplifiers were used due to the fast timing and acquisition nature of the Pixie-16 modules and DDAS. 

\section{Beam Production}

Because of the use of HPGe detectors in an $(\alpha,2n)$ reaction, the neutron flux must be minimized in comparison to the cross section of the reaction, as the $(\alpha,n)$ reaction is also open. To do this, a range of energies to test were selected by looking at theoretical cross sections in Talys\citep{koning07:_talys}. These energies were then tested with natural Sm targets, ICEBall, and two liquid scintillators to detect neutrons.

Samarium, as with many even-Z elements in the lanthanide region, has many stable isotopes. A total of five stable isotopes of Samarium exist, with two other isotopes being long-lived. Table \ref{tab:nat_Sm} summarizes the abundances and lifetimes of the various isotopes found in natural Samarium. The two isotopes to be used in enriched targets in the experiments have the highest natural abundances, $^{152,154}$Sm.

\input{Setup_Figs/nat_sm}

\subsection{Talys Calculations}

Talys \citep{koning07:_talys} is software for the simulation of nuclear reactions. Cross sections can be estimated using Talys to guide where an experiment may want to run to optimize production, as is the case presently. 

Both natural and enriched samarium targets were used and modelled within Talys. A range of energies, from 14 MeV to 24 MeV $\alpha$-particles were run. These energies allowed a large number of potential reaction products from elastic, inelastic, transfer, and knockout reactions. Figure \ref{fig:talys} is a visual summary of the strongest modelled reactions in the natural samarium target. It was decided to test the energies between 16-21 MeV.

\input{Setup_Figs/Talys.tex}

\subsection{Test Analysis and Results}

To test these Talys calculations and determine the best running energy, the cross section and neutron flux had to be measured at each energy without the use of the HPGe detectors. ICEBall was used to measure the cross section by examining the K-electrons from ground-state band transitions in the reactions of interest, as the ground-state band is the most significantly populated band in the reaction.

The neutrons were measured using two NE213 liquid organic scintillators. In these detectors, it is possible to do pulse shape discrimination, as the neutrons have longer decay times than the gammas in these detectors due to the nature of the interaction with the scintillating liquid \citep{knoll00:rad_det_meas}. This produces longer trails in the detectors, leading to different decay shapes, see Figure \ref{fig:pulse_discrimination}. 

\input{Setup_Figs/pulse_discrimination.tex}

By plotting the pulse height against the decay tail time, neutrons and gammas can be separated. In this setup, this was done by sending the signal to a Mesytec MPD-4 (Multi-channel Pulse Discriminator) \citep{mesytec:_PSD}. This is a module built for pulse discrimination. It splits the signal, amplifies for the pulse height, and sends the other signal to a constant fraction discriminator (CFD), which converts the value to an amplitude using a time to analog converter (TAC). A CFD works by measuring the time it takes for a pulse to decrease to a fraction of its original height. Both of these signals (the pulse amplitude and the TAC amplitude) are recorded in the data. Plotting these values in a two-dimensional plot distinguishes the gammas and neutrons, as in Figure \ref{fig:neutron}. There is a threshold cut off that removed most gammas from the spectrum.

\input{Setup_Figs/neutron_fig.tex}

Once the detectors were calibrated, each energy was run, with a total of four different targets across six energies. For each energy, the peaks in the electron spectra were identified with their respective isotopes, working under the assumption that only the lowest-lying states and the ground-state band would be populated significantly enough to see the electrons. These peaks are representative of the reaction cross section for that isotope. The K-electron of the $4^+\rightarrow2^+$ ground state transition for both nuclei of interest was clearly visible and clean at all energies, listed in Table \ref{tab:neutron_electron}. These K-electrons were used for the cross-section calculation.

\input{Setup_Figs/neutron_electron_table.tex}

To calculate the cross section, the formula

\begin{equation}
    \sigma=\frac{Yield}{\delta x*Q*\epsilon}
    \label{eq:xs}
\end{equation}

was used, where $\delta x$ is the target thickness, $Q$ is the integrated charge, and $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of the Si(Li) detector at the electron energy. The $Yield$ is the area under the curve.

This then had to be compared with the neutron production cross section. A bunched beam was used to get a time-of-flight. Calculating the neutron flux was done using the formula

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_n = \frac{Neutrons}{\delta x*Q}
\end{equation}

where $\delta x$ and $Q$ are the same as used for the cross section. The neutron yield is obtained by pulse shape discrimination, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:neutron}. The left-most line is the gamma-flash that comes from the prompt gammas. The secondary gathering of counts, to the right, is the neutron peak. This area can be integrated over to get the number of neutrons seen during the run.

Table \ref{tab:neutrons} summarizes the results at each energy. Note, that the cross section is not reflective of the full cross section of the isotopes, but of the K-electrons for that transition. This ratio, of the cross-section to the neutron flux, was ultimately used to determine the running energy. The two higher energies, 20 and 21 MeV, have a ratio that agrees within error for both isotopes, indicating a plateau, in agreement with the expectation from Talys. Ultimately, 20 MeV was chosen for two reasons: to minimize any higher energy reaction channels, and because the neutron flux was lower in rate.

\input{Setup_Figs/neutron_summary}

\subsection{Experimental Beam Operation}

The experiments with GEORGINA were done using a bunched beam, creating a set timing signal to help with coincidence. The beam was bunched before the accelerator, with a time separation of 600 ns between bunches. The timing of these bunches is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bunched}. Clear separation in of the bunches is visible.
