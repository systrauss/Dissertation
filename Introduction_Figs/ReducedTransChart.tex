    \caption{A plot of the reduced transition rate between the first excited $2^+$ state and the ground state in even-even nuclei, in single particle units. Areas of low rates, around A$\sim$90,140,210, correspond to closed shells, while the areas around A$\sim$110,170,250, have much higher rates, and correspond to deformed nuclei. Taken from \citep{casten90:_structure}.}
