    \caption{The evolution of the shell model and the creation of the closed shells of a spherical nucleus. On the left is the spherical harmonic oscillator. By changing the potential to the Woods-Saxon potential, creating a flat centered potential well, the degenerate states of the harmonic oscillator separate in energy. By further adding a spin-coupling term, the levels separate with energy spacings that create the closed shells and the magic numbers.}
