    \caption{The energy of the first excited $2^+$ state, plotted in isotopic chains, by mass. Areas of high excitation energy, around A$\sim$90,140,210 all correspond to doubly magic areas. The areas around A$\sim$110,170 have much lower excitation energies and correspond to areas of deformation.  Taken from \citep{casten90:_structure}}
