    \caption{The theoretical K-shell conversion coefficients for the magnetic and electric multipoles for $l=1,2,3$, calculated using BrICC \citep{kibedi08:_BRICC}. Each of the multipoles is distinct. Further distinction between multipoles can be seen by plotting the intensity ratios between different electronic shells.}
