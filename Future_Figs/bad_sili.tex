    \caption{A comparison of the singles spectrum of one Si(Li) detector between the GEORGINA and Clovershare experiments. The resolution of the Si(Li) detector has deteriorated between the two experiments (the GEORGINA one was performed first). The LM peaks at \~{}240 keV and \~{}330 keV show this most clearly. The peaks are distinguishable in the GEORGINA data, but not in the Clovershare data.}
