    \caption{Trigger rate of the background with respect to time, after running on one of the carbon-backed targets. There is a clear indication of an exponential decay, shown by the fit. The slope corresponds to a half-life of 133(5) seconds. $^{15}$O has a half-life of 122 seconds, within an acceptable error with the low statistics of the run.}
