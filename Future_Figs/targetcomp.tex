    \caption{Comparison of the thick (self-supporting) and thin (carbon-backed) targets. The spectra were taken during the same experiment. At low energies, the resolution is better in the thin target. Further, the energies of the peaks shift based on which target it is. This spectrum is not energy calibrated.}
