    \caption{Various width profiles tested for the magnets. The left figure shows the cross-shape for the width profiles. The left side goes against the central blocker. Variable gradients were looked at, starting with linear slopes, but evolving into step functions and piecewise linear slopes as the simulations expanded.}
