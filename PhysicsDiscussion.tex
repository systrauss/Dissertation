\section{Dynamic Moments of Inertia}
\label{sec:Dynamic}

Something something moment of inertia.

\subsection{Bands in $^{154}$Gd}
\label{sec:154_Dynamic}

To examine the structure of the bands seen in this experiment, the dynamic moments of inertia can be compared. This is usually done with higher spins, but examination at lower spins can allow for more bands to be compared. The energy difference tracks linearly, with the slope being directly correlated to the moment of inertia of the band, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:154_Dynamic0} and Figure \ref{fig:154_Dynamic}. The slopes of these bands are summarized in Table \ref{tab:154_Dynamic}. Slopes with an error had enough points to calculate the error on the slope. Those without error had only two points or, in the case of the second excited $2^+$ band, one point and the origin. These points each require two levels of the band to be known for calculation. The intercept was left to float, but not included, as it was in agreement with 0 in all cases where error could be calculated.

Figure \ref{fig:154_Dynamic0} shows the $0^+$ bands. The first excited $0^+$ band has a very similar slope to the ground state band, as seen both in Figure \ref{fig:154_Dynamic0} and Table \ref{tab:154_Dynamic}. The two bands agree within $2\sigma$. While the $\gamma$-band also appears similar in slope to the ground state band in Figure \ref{fig:154_Dynamic}, they do not overlap within $3\sigma$. The first $4^+$ excited band does have a slope within $2\sigma$ of the $\gamma$-band.

\label{sec:156_Dynamic}

To examine the structure of the band seen in this experiment, the dynamic moments of inertia can be compared. This is usually done at higher spins, but examination at lower spins can allow for more bands to be compared. The energy difference tracks linearly, with the slope being directly correlated to the moment of inertia of the band, as seen in Figures \ref{fig:156_Dynamic0} and \ref{fig:156_Dynamic}. The slopes of these bands are summarized in Table \ref{tab:156_Dynamic}. Slopes with an error had enough points to calculate the error on the slope.

Figure \ref{fig:156_Dynamic0} shows the moments of inertia of the $0^+$ bands, including the ground state band. The first excited $0^+$ band has a very similar slope to the ground state band, as seen both in Figure \ref{fig:156_Dynamic0} and Table \ref{tab:156_Dynamic}. The two bands agree within $2\sigma$. The $\gamma$-band and the excited $4^+$ band also appear similar in slope to the ground state band in Figure \ref{fig:156_Dynamic}, and overlap within $2\sigma$. The first $4^+$ excited band is almost identical in slope to the first excited $0^+$ band. Both of these bands are about $1\sigma$ apart.
