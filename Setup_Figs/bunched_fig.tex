    \caption{This is a plot of the HPGe 1 detector time minus the buncher time. Two distinct peaks can be seen in the spectrum, the main timing peak close to 0, and the much smaller secondary peak, coming from a second bunching signal. The bunching signal only acts as a stop signal for the timing. It can also be used as a veto, as events without a valid buncher time are not real, or are background.}
