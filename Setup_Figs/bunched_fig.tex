    \caption{This is a plot of the HPGe 1 detector time minus the buncher time. Two distinct peaks can be seen in the spectrum, the main timing peak close to channel 800, and the much smaller secondary peak, coming from a second, later bunching signal. The bunching signal only acts as a stop signal for the timing. It can also be used as a veto, as events without a valid buncher time are not real, or are background.}
