    \caption{Talys calculation of the highest cross sections divided by the total neutron yield in the natural Samarium target. Only the largest contributors are included, as there are a large number of products possible between the isotopes of Samarium in the target and the reactions channels open for each. All of the largest contributors are Gadolinium isotopes. The ratios for the isotopes of interest appear to plateau around 20-22 MeV.}
