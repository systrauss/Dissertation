    \caption{ICEBall modeled in Autodesk Inventor \citep{autodesk:_inventor} with the Clovershare detectors placed around it in locations to optimize efficiency. Once ICEBall had been modeled, the detectors were moved around to make sure they were not behind the tungsten blockers. The beamline was also modeled to know where obstructions existed that prevent the Clovershare detectors from being place there.}
