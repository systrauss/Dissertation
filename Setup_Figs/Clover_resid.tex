    \caption{A look at the energy calibration of an individual leaf in an HPGe Clover detector. The upper graph is a linear calibration. The lower graph is a look at the residuals. For HPGe detectors, $\pm0.4$ keV is not a good energy calibration. Here, the sawtooth fit that was derived from the differential non-linearity in the electronics is seen fitted to the data.}
