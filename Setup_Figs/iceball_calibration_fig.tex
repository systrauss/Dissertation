    \caption{Linear and quadratic energy calibrations of one Si(Li) detector, using the electron energies listed in Table \ref{tab:ICE_Cal_Source}. The top graphs show the calibrations, while the graphs beneath show the respective residuals. The calibration is in much better agreement in the quadratic fit, as seen in the residuals.}
