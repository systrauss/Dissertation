    \caption{An example of one of the GEORGINA detectors. The crystal is at a $90^{\circ}$ from the cold finger, allowing the long side of the crystal to be placed next to the target, to optimize solid angle coverage. In the experiment, the circular face of the crystal was placed toward the target.}
