    \captionlistentry{Level Scheme of $^{156}$Gd. The gamma ray of the $2^+_{gs}\rightarrow 0^+_{gs}$ (89 keV) transition in the ground state was gated on. It was then compared with the gated spectrum from the gamma ray of the $4^+_{gs}\rightarrow 2^+_{gs}$ (199 keV) transition in the ground state. Peaks only appearing in the first gate were assumed to go into the $2^+_{gs}$ state, and assignments were made. Due to the low energy of the $2^+_{gs}\rightarrow 0^+_{gs}$ transition, the efficiency was lower, and it is likely that transitions into the $2^+_{gs}$ state were missed. The levels are organized by band. The lower levels of the band, unseen by gamma rays in this gate, are in blue.}
