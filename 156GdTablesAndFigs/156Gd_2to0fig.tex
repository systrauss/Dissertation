    \caption{\label{fig:156_2to0level}Level Scheme of $^{156}$Gd. The gamma ray of the $2^+$\rightarrow$0^+$ (89 keV) transition in the ground state was gated on. It was then compared with the gated spectrum from the gamma ray of the $4^+$\rightarrow$2^+$ (199 keV) transition in the ground state. Peaks only appearing in the first gate were assumed to go into the $2^+$ state, and assignments were made. Due to the low energy of the $2^+$\rightarrow$0^+$ transition, the efficiency was lower, and it is likely that transitions into the $2^+$ state were missed. The levels are organized by band. The lower levels of the band, unseen by gamma rays in this gate, are in gray.}
