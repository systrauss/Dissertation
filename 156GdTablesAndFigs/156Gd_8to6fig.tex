    \captionlistentry{(a) Level Scheme of $^{156}$Gd. The gamma ray of the $8^+_{gs}\rightarrow 6^+_{gs}$ (380 keV) transition in the ground state was gated on. It was then compared with the gated spectrum from the gamma ray of the $10^+_{gs}\rightarrow 8^+_{gs}$ (451 keV) transition in the ground state. Peaks only appearing in the first gate were assumed to go into the $8^+_{gs}$ state, and assignments were made. Additionally, these peaks were also gated on, to look for cascades leading into the $8^+_{gs}$ state, which were found in several cases. The levels are organized by band. The lower levels of the band, unseen by gamma rays in this gate, are in blue. (b) Gamma spectrum gated on 380 keV, corresponding to the $8^+_{gs}\rightarrow 6^+_{gs}$ transition. Several transitions are marked according to the level scheme.}
