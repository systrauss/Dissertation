    \caption{\label{fig:156_6to4level}Level Scheme of $^{156}$Gd. The gamma ray of the $6^+$\rightarrow$4^+$ (296 keV) transition in the ground state was gated on. It was then compared with the gated spectrum from the gamma ray of the $8^+$\rightarrow$6^+$ (380 keV) transition in the ground state. Peaks only appearing in the first gate were assumed to go into the $6^+$ state, and assignments were made. Additionally, these peaks were also gated on, to look for cascades leading into the $6^+$ state, which were found in several cases. The levels are organized by band. The lower levels of the band, unseen by gamma rays in this gate, are in gray.}
