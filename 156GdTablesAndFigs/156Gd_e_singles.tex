    \caption{Electron singles for $^{156}$Gd. The energies of transitions between $0^+$ states are marked in the plot. In this spectrum, the $0^+_{3}\rightarrow 0^+_{gs}$ transition is the most prominent. The $0^+_{2}\rightarrow 0^+_{gs}$ and $0^+_{4}\rightarrow 0^+_{3}$ transitions appears to have sone strength, but are obscured by other conversion electrons in the data. The $0^+_{3}\rightarrow 0^+_{2}$ transition is at too low an energy to distinguish from the high background at low energies.}
