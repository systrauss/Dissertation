	    \multicolumn{6}{p{\textwidth}}{Ratios of the $B(E0)$ values in $^{156}Gd$. Only ratios between two transitions of the same state are listed, as the lifetime of the states are unknown. Table \ref{tab:156Gd_E0} lists the values that were used in the calculation. The gates are included, as an efficiency correction was made on the ratio based on the gates. In many cases, only upper or lower limits for the values could be used for this calculation. Errors are not given on these values. Those values marked with errors or as limits had defined values instead of limits.}
