        Table \ref{tab:0plus_154}: A list of all $0^+$ states in $^{154}$Gd. All the states listed were seen in Meyer et al, a $(p,t)$ experiment\citep{meyer06:_zeroplus}. $0^+$ states above approximately 2184 keV would not be seen in this experiment, the energy of the $12^+$ ground state, as that is the energy cut off in the nucleus for state population, discussed in the text. The levels seen in this exceed previous $(\alpha,2n)$ experiments and agree with the levels seen in Spits \citep{spits96:_154gd}. Until Spits, there was no known spectroscopy for the 1182, 1573 and 1650 keV states, having only been seen previously in $(p,t)$ and $(t,p)$ experiments. No $(\alpha,2n)$ experiments with $\gamma-\gamma$ coincidence, looking for such levels have been run since Spits et al was published.
