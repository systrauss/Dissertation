    \caption{(a) The dynamic moments of inertia of the non-$0^+$ bands seen in the experiment. As is seen visually and with the slopes, the ground state band and the $\gamma$ band have similar moments of inertia, and overlap within two standard deviations. (b) The dynamic moments of inertia of the four $0^+$ bands seen in the experiment. As is seen visually and with the slopes, the ground state band and the first excited $0^+$ band have very similar moments of inertia.}
