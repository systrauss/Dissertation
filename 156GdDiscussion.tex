\chapter{$^{156}$Gd Results}
\normalsize

$^{156}$Gd is of interest to study due to the deformed nature of the nucleus. It is known to have 6 excited $0^+$ states, allowing for many potential transitions between two states of the same $J^\pi$. This data was taken with ICEBall and GEORGINA. The experiment used an enriched $^{154}$Sm target of 1.7 $mg/cm^2$ thickness, as discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:setup} and shown in Table \ref{tab:target}. A complete catalog of spectra used in analysis can be found in Appendix \ref{chap:156_spectra}.

\section{Ground State Band Confirmation}

Looking at the singles spectra of the data, several prominent peaks stand out, seen in Figure \ref{fig:156_Singles}. In the $\gamma$-spectrum on top, there are three prominent peaks from 100 to 400 keV. These peaks are the ground state band transitions from the $2^+$ state up to the $8^+$ state. The transition from the $2^+$ state to the ground state is only 89 keV, and while visible, suffers from a steep efficiency drop-off at that energy, and a large background due to x-rays. The strong peak just beyond 500 keV is the 511 keV annihilation peak. The conversion electron spectrum obeneath has clear $K$-shell and $L$-shell peaks corresponding to these ground state band transitions. 

\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156GdSingles_Fig.tex}

As in the previous chapter, these transitions in the ground state are the first lines looked at in the data. These are all pure E2 multipole transitions, making them a diagnostic on the data compared with the theoretical coefficients from BrIcc\citep{kibedi08:_BRICC}. The transitions from $2^+$ to $10^+$ are summarized and compared with theory in Table \ref{tab:156Gd_Single_ICC_GS}.

Unlike the $^{154}$Gd data, there did not appear to be contaminants in these ground state lines, outside of the $2_{gs}^+\rightarrow0_{gs}^+$ transition. This transition was also considered unreliable, as the low energy of the $\gamma$-ray put it before the efficiency turnover. The change in efficiency in the HPGe detectors is steep in this region, leading to large uncertainty.

\section{Gates on the Ground State Band}

The transitions of the ground state band are the most prominent peaks in the spectra (Figure \ref{fig:156_Singles}). The high number of counts in these peaks made them prime candidates to gate on and build up a level scheme. Only the $\gamma$ components were gated on, as the electron components wide width made it difficult to gate on the whole of the peak without contaminants. Figures \ref{fig:156_2to0}, \ref{fig:156_4to2}, \ref{fig:156_6to4}, and \ref{fig:156_8to6} are the result of these gates. Unlike the gates in $^{154}$Gd, the $4_{gs}^+\rightarrow2_{gs}^+$ gate was the most fruitful, due to the challenges of the $_{gs}2^+\rightarrow0_{gs}^+$ transition posed.

Determining which transitions went uniquely into a given ground state level was done by comparing the outgoing ground state transition for that level with the incoming transitions, i.e. the $4_{gs}^+\rightarrow2_{gs}^+$ (199 keV) gate was compared directions with the $6_{gs}^+\rightarrow4_{gs}^+$ (296 keV) gate. The $\gamma$-spectra corresponding to these lines can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:156_GS_Gate}. Lines in the gamma spectrum that were present only in the outgoing spectrum, but not the incoming spectrum, are going into that level (the $4_{gs}^+$ in the example above). Identified transitions were then gated on to confirm assignments and search for cascades from higher energy states.

\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd_stackFig.tex}

In this data, the secondary gate check is especially important, as the low efficiency of the $2_{gs}^+\rightarrow0_{gs}^+$ transition would mean weaker lines going into the $2_{gs}^+$ state could be falsely assigned going into the $4_{gs}^+$ state. As the ground state band transitions are so prolific, the transitions showed up when gating on weaker peaks in the spectra, while the inverse was not always true. The spectra from these gates are available in Appendix \ref{chap:156_spectra}.

Little could be seen in the $2_{gs}^+\rightarrow0_{gs}^+$ gate, as it reflected in Figure \ref{fig:156_2to0}. The $4_{gs}^+\rightarrow2_{gs}^+$ gate shows far more, seen in Figure \ref{fig:156_4to2}, including evidence of populating 3 excited $0^+$ bands. In total, nine bands were seen in the gating outside of the ground state band. The number of bands seen drops off with higher gates, both due to the drop off in populating higher energy states and the drop off in populating higher $J$ states. Also seen in the gates are the $\gamma$-vibrational band, the $K=1^-$ octopole band, and a $K=4^+$ band.

\section{Conversion Coefficients from Singles}

With the gamma-rays now identified through gates, conversion coefficients could be calculated from singles spectra. Tables \ref{tab:156Gd_Single_ICC_Corr}, \ref{tab:156Gd_Single_ICC_Uncorr}, and \ref{tab:156Gd_No_Mult_ICC} are these results. Where available, results were compared with Konijn et al\citep{konijn81:_156gd}. Results are compared against this data, as it also examined the nucleus via an $(\alpha,2n)$ reaction.

Transitions that could be clearly identified and separated are found in Table \ref{tab:156Gd_Single_ICC_Corr}. Contamination concerns were taken into account by using the identified transitions to look for gamma-rays in close proximity to those in the table. These transitions all have known multipole assignments and mixing ratios as needed, allowing for angular corrections. Two transitions with possible $E0$ components are seen in this table. One, the $2^+\rightarrow2^+$ transition, appears to have a clear E0 component. Although this transition was not used in Figure \ref{fig:156_2to0}, the band the state exists in is populated, as seen in Figures \ref{fig:156_4to2}, \ref{fig:156_6to4}, and \ref{fig:156_8to6}. The $6^+\rightarrow6^+$ transition does not appear to have an $E0$ component. While the value agrees with Konijn\citep{konijn81:_156gd}, it does not agree with the theoretical value for an $E2$, the multipole the transition has been assigned.

\afterpage{\clearpage\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156GdSinglesCorr}}

Table \ref{tab:156Gd_Single_ICC_Uncorr} holds conversion coefficients that have been left uncorrected in the singles for one of two reasons: either there were multiple known assignments to the gamma-ray energy, or the exact multipole mixing-ratio $\delta$ was unknown. Several of these transitions are high energy $J^\pi\rightarrow J^\pi$ transitions if the assignment is correct without extra contamination. This includes a $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ transition. The Si(Li) efficiency at these energies was too low to see the conversion electrons in gated spectra.

\afterpage{\clearpage\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156GdSinglesUncorr}}

Table \ref{tab:156Gd_No_Mult_ICC} has conversion coefficients that could not be corrected due to the transitions having unknown multipole assignments. Allowable and reasonable theoretical conversion coefficients from BrIcc\citep{kibedi08:_BRICC} are listed in the table.

\section{$J^{\pi}\rightarrow J^{\pi}$ Transitions}

\subsection{$0^{+}\rightarrow 0^{+}$ Identification and Population}

With the large number of $0^+$ states in $^{156}$Gd, it was necessary to identify which were populated. Table \ref{tab:0plus_156} contains a list of $0^+$ states from NNDC, with notes as to which $0^+$ states have been previously observed in the reaction used in this work.

\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156_0plus_table}

The states seen in this work are consistent with those seen in other $(\alpha,2n)$ experiments and include higher states. The energies of the $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ transitions from these states are marked in the electron singles in Figure \ref{fig:156_e_singles}.

\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd_e_singles}

To obtain information in these areas, and for possible $J^{\pi}\rightarrow J^{\pi}$ transitions, energy gates were used. A full list of gates and spectra can be found in Appendix \ref{ch:156_spectra}.

\subsection{$J^{\pi}\rightarrow J^{\pi}$ Transitions from Gates}

After identification of the bands and transitions, gates were put on the transitions both entering and leaving states of interest, namely even-$J^+$ states. Gates entering these states (incoming transitions) were not fruitful. This is unfortunate for the $0^+$ states, as only incoming transitions can be used for transitions to the ground state. Gates leaving the states (outgoing transitions), had more statistics, and results could be obtained. $J^\pi\rightarrow J^\pi$ transitions up to $4^+$ were seen. Tables \ref{tab:156Gd_0_to_0}, \ref{tab:156Gd_2_to_2}, and \ref{tab:156Gd_4_to_4} are the tabulated results. These values are compared with Konijn\citep{konijn81:_156gd} where available. Additionally, the theoretical conversion coefficients have been listed for the $M1$ and $E2$ transitions, as taken from BrIcc\citep{kibedi08:_BRICC}.

In Table \ref{tab:156Gd_0_to_0}, only one $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ transition could be seen with enough statistics to get a value. All other possible $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ transitions were at high energies with such low efficiency in the Si(Li) detectors that a peak could not be seen.
    
\afterpage{\clearpage\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd0to0}}

In Table \ref{tab:156Gd_2_to_2}, only one transition had a previously measured value. It does not appear to have an $E0$ component. The other transitions with upper limits do not eliminate the possibility of an $E0$ component. Of the two transitions with lower limits, one (104 keV) appears to have a sizeable $E0$ component, while the other transition does not eliminate the possibility of a pure $E2$ transition.

\afterpage{\clearpage\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd2to2}}

\afterpage{\clearpage\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd4to4}}
   
In Table \ref{tab:156Gd_4_to_4}, none of the transitions had a previously measured value. Three of the four transitions' lower limits give no new information. The final one appears to indicate there is an $E0$ component, with the lower limit higher than the theoretical $M1$ coefficient. 

\input{156GdTablesAndFigs/156Gd_E0_0}

Due to the lack of lifetimes of these states, $B(E0)$ values cannot be calculated. However, the relative intensities of these values can be compared, assuming they are coming from the same state, as the lifetime would divide out (see equations \ref{eq:rho_life} and \ref{eq:BEO}). The contributions from the individual components of the transition must be separated out for the $2^+$ and $4^+$ transitions. This was done by getting the $q^2$ values multiplied by the theoretical $\alpha(E2)$, which gives an estimate of $E0$ intensity (see section \ref{sec:E0}). None of the transitions have known $\delta$ mixing ratios, so $\delta$ was assumed to be 1, and the theoretical mixed $M1$ and $E2$ $\alpha$ was subtracted. In some cases, this left a negative value, which has been excluded from the table of results, Table \ref{tab:156Gd_E0}. All values calculated are upper or lower limits, as the $\alpha$ calculated in the previous tables were upper and lower limits. Table \ref{tab:156Gd_E0_0} contains the calculated $q^2$ and $\rho^2$ value for the 1168 keV to 1049 keV $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ transition, as the 1168 keV level has an experimental lifetime \citep{aprahamian18:_156gd}.

With these values, two transitions from the same level can be compared using the $B(E0)$ formula to take the energy adjustment into account. It is also adjusted by the ratio of the rate efficiencies. Only one $2^+$ level had transitions to other $2^+$ states that could be compared. This ratio is in Table \ref{tab:156Gd_BE0_Comp}. There is no error, as the two compared values were both upper limits. The number seems to indicate the 1827 keV level has approximately equal transition strength to the 1129 keV and the 1154 keV $2^+$ states.
